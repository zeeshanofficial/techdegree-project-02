In this project, i have build a List Pagination and filtering web application  
This is a popular and very common web development technique known as "pagination" to enhance the usability of a web page.

Features :zap: :  
• Display 10 list items at a time.  
• Navigation System with cool css active state buttons  
• Principle of "progressive enhancement" is employed here  
• Works with any number of list items, flexible enough to respond to lists of different lengths
